/* difference between null and undefined 
undefined toh mtlb intentionally blank hai 
and null means ki koi value hai hi ni */

/* A variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value is undefined
null is an assignment value that explicitly indicates the absence of any object value. */

/* for uniqueness symbol datatype is used */

console.log(typeof null)  // it is of type object
console.log(typeof undefined) // it is of type undefined which means it has a separate type
